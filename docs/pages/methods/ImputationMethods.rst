Imputation Methods
==================

Imputation methods are vital in data fusion as they address the common
issue of missing data, ensuring the completeness and usability of the
datasets. These methods estimate and fill in the missing values based on
various statistical and machine learning techniques, such as mean,
median, mode, K-Nearest Neighbors and interpolation. The choice of
imputation method depends on the nature of the data and the missingness
mechanism. By accurately estimating missing values, imputation methods
enhance the quality of the data, leading to more reliable analyses and
predictions, and hence, more informed decision-making.

1. **KNN**: This method uses the K-Nearest Neighbors approach to impute
   missing values. It identifies the **``k``** observations in the
   dataset that are closest to the observation with the missing value
   and estimates the missing value based on these **``k``** nearest
   neighbors.
2. **Mean**: This method uses the mean of each column to fill missing
   values. It calculates the average value of each column and uses this
   value to replace any missing values. This method assumes that the
   data is normally distributed.
3. **Most Frequent**: This method uses the mode of each column to fill
   missing values. It identifies the most frequently occurring value in
   each column and uses this value to replace any missing values. This
   method is particularly useful for categorical data.
4. **Median**: This method uses the median of each column to fill
   missing values. It identifies the middle value of each column when
   the values are arranged in ascending order and uses this value to
   replace any missing values. This method is less sensitive to outliers
   than the mean method.
5. **Interpolate**: This method uses the Interpolation method to fill
   missing values. It estimates the missing values by constructing a
   function that fits the existing data and using this function to
   predict the missing values. This method is particularly useful for
   time series data where there is a trend or pattern.
